    <p>More and more, I step away from social media. More and more often. I find little to no benefit in it. The issue that brings me back to it is simple: I am very alone. I have my co-workers, my father, my mother, brother and my son. Those are the only people who seem to be consistently there. Sometimes I think that living in the city would simplify the issue but... that would be difficult to manage making happen.</p><br><p>I disappeared and no one noticed.</p><br><p>It seems sanity is slowly slipping away in regards to the general populace and as it does, I retract more and more.</p><br><p>(5/12/2025)I went back, to some small degree, to social media. I fell back into the same trappings, the same routines and had to run away, yet again. the problem is so, so easy for myself to get away from but... if I want other people to actually try to be active in my life. It's almost as though they forget you exist once you go online. We're destroying ourselves on a social-structure level through our ever-increasing reliance on technology to replace various aspects in our lives. How much longer until AI-driven classrooms via VR begin to pop-up and replace in-person classrooms? The damage such a thing could cause... and I don't doubt we'd go for it, push for it...</p>
