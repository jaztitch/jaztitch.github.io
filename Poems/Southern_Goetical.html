    <li><b>Brave Heart</b><br>Keep it clean and quiet<br>she said with a smile.<br>A punk rock princess<br>to make me feel royal.<br>I watched the moon tonight<br>she was so bright<br>the city lights<br>found a new hue<br>the night creeps in<br>I’m terrified<br>that’s the only way<br>to be brave<br>the only way<br>to know<br>that something’s there<br>waiting.<br></li><br>

<li><b>Beams</b><br>Make your own happiness<br>rely on no one<br>but always remember<br>not to be alone.<br>Your friends will<br>be the beam<br>holding your world together<br>while the roses will sing.<br>Remember that there are other worlds<br>than this.<br>The most unlikely situation<br>found<br>Eddie and Susannah<br>and Blaine<br>may be a pain<br>but he helped<br>somehow.<br></li><br>

<li><b>Curves</b>The way that flowers unfurl<br>reminds me of her<br>way of waking, stretching,<br>milk-white breasts rising<br>to eclipse the morning sun.<br>Her arched back lifting sheets<br>to reveal curves<br>that could kill a man<br>dead.<br></li><br>

<li><b>Skirt</b><br>Her skirt lifts as she spins<br>I wish we were alone again.<br>While company is great,<br>I wish to lay there<br>untangling hair and<br>speaking to nothing.<br>Of course, I’m happy<br>as long as<br>she is.<br>However, her eyes<br>already state<br>that she feels the same way.<br>This is the longest<br>and the shortest<br>night I’ve had<br>with you.<br></li><br>

<li><b>Liquidauralconnection</b><br>Bellows raise the fires<br>danger, Will Robinson, Danger, dumbass.<br>Fly, you fool, fly.<br>I’m sorry, Dave, I’m afraid I can’t let you do that.<br>She could break you so easily<br>you’re drifting into dangerous territory.<br>It’s grasping at me<br>what’s grabbing me?<br>Will I bleed?<br>If we travel any further into this territory<br>there might not be any coming back<br>not if I take it slowly,<br>to be free<br>these are dangerous people<br>on a whim, they might,<br>take your heart from its cell<br>walk, with every bit fo hell<br>rings a happy bell<br>let the flowers die slowly<br>they might consume it<br>my heart is a harp<br>that she unknowingly plays<br>we must first sense them,<br>figure out their desires<br>and work from there<br>this ship is fragile<br>and the shields are down<br>hon, she said<br>to the captain<br>I want you in my bed<br>let loose, don’t let loose, don’t go don’t<br>slipping slowly<br>into a vector<br>sorry, dear, I want you near<br>I want your heart and soul more than<br>your music box.<br>Twitching, danger, unknown planet, what sector?<br>must take safety to<br>5*1*18*20*7<br>home.<br>I saw the beauty by the record machine<br>she took my hand and led me<br>houston, can you hear me?<br>I came with the goddess of death from out west<br>get to my head<br>the robots have lost it<br>programming failure onboard<br>Danger, why can’t they let me do this?<br>why panick?

<li><b>wake</b><br>Awoke after three hours of rest<br>to find myself<br>drenched in sweat<br>hostile message<br>another that felt<br>an awful lot<br>like rejection<br>when hours ago<br>she was so sweet.<br>I won’t be bothered by<br>any of this<br>that which does not<br>further my life<br>or increase happiness<br>does not matter<br>for too long, I’ve cared<br>no more<br>for<br>I grow<br>to be<br>the most I can be<br>I live<br>for no one.<br></li><br>

<li><b>Religious romanticism</b><br>Agnosticism<br>edging towards<br>Atheism<br>the deity has<br>disrespected me<br>publicly<br>acting out towards<br>a new goal<br>not acting so old.<br>I find<br>myself<br>hearing from the walls<br>of last night.<br>Weilling to find<br>a new path.<br>We will see<br>just how honest<br>a Goddess<br>you can be.<br>This won’t be<br>the first time<br>I lost my religion.<br></li><br>

<li><b>A symphony</b><br>Tired, we spoke of music and stories<br>laughing after a long morning<br>we slept and smoked with Lana Del Rey<br>wasting away the rest of the day.<br>We had slipped<br>into a fugue state<br>effervescent, soporific, hypnogogic<br>world of surrealism<br>without the loss<br>of who I am.<br>A mix of<br>synonyms and antonyms<br>to create<br>a different kind of state.<br></li><br>

<li><b>Ashpyxiating Ghosts</b><br>It knocked rapidly upon the door in my head<br>seeking to consume every breath<br>getting lost in my own mind is a chore<br>navigating that lost dungeon of failed hopes<br>labyrinthian misery, blood congealed<br>go ahead and consume me<br>cause right now, I’m alone<br>and won’t<br>drag anyone else into this<br>marina’s trench<br>of frozen hell.<br></li><br>

<li><b>We were not born in sin.</b><br>I was not born to drown<br>you were nto born to suffer<br>we were not born in sin.<br>Yet, we still pretend this is all we’ve got<br>I still drown in memories and alcohol<br>you & I both suffer the floods<br>and we still feel ashamed of<br>who we are.<br>I’m changing my perspective<br>growing to accept that these things<br>are not inevitable<br>that nothing is inevitable but death<br>and before I pass away<br>I fully intend<br>to live my own way.<br></li><br>

<li><b>Blood of the teeth</b><br>Blood spills from between my crooked teeth<br>they’re to remind me of jagged failures<br>this weekend, I ate more than the weekdays<br>during which my heart bled poisonous wroth<br>thoughts are consuming, the reasons so many<br>escape with their habitual consumptions<br>their addictions, because they don’t know<br>how to forget every blade that they’ve forged<br>how to forget every page that they’ve wrote<br>these boundaries exhaust me<br>only because<br>I let myself grow weak.<br>I became<br>something<br>lesser than me.<br></li><br>

<li><b>The winding night</b><br>I’m going 70 in a 45,<br>gasoline spilt in my trunk,<br>getting me high<br>these curves are a little tight<br>for the speed I’m travelling<br>can’t get past how<br>the sun and the moon<br>were out together earlier<br>the moon with her children<br>the stars<br>and the sun with all of his<br>brilliant fury and rage<br>fighting his eternal war<br>against her peaceful, quiet love.<br>In the morning, I get up,<br>quietly make and prepare coffee<br>put on music, rest, shower, relax, write.<br>Inside, I wonder why I haven’t died<br>cause I fight the impulse to<br>stop in oncoming traffic<br>to overdose<br>fill my lungs with helium<br>drown in ethanol<br>or purchase a firearm<br>etcetera, etcetera<br>I fight these urges for no reason<br>but that these actions are meaningless<br>so I’ll quietly go one hundred miles an hour<br>on the interstate<br>quietly say come what may<br>but the truth is<br>I want to be there<br>for my son<br>and all of my loved ones<br>these feelings are a loaded gun<br>and I can’t ever<br>see me<br>getting any<br>better<br>anytime<br>soon.<br></li><br>

<li><b>If you want to find hell with me...</b><br>Today, I fought the rare desire to quell the fires<br>with amphetamines, codeine, alcohol and weed<br>like I did before.<br>I ripped apart a few problems,<br>grappled the facts<br>presented my presentation just before going to<br>another quiet day of “say hey<br>what was I supposed to do again?”<br>Yeah, I’ve lost tracking, interlaced videos playing<br>I know very few understand what I’m saying<br>through subconscious streams of thought<br>presented upon ancient weathered rock.<br>Today I fought desires born of rage and<br>a desire of peace. I hope this possibility<br>might work out for me<br>but<br>I have grown jaded<br>lost every ounce of faith I once had<br>within life’s stream.<br></li><br>

    <ol>
<li><b>Something New</b><br>You and I raised hell<br>in the Alabama night.<br>We stole Signs,<br>laughing throughout<br>our long, roving ride<br>‘til the sun come up<br>&<br>I woke to find<br>you’d left my side<br>and as the leaves all fell<br>the wind cooled,<br>our demons sought<br>for something new.</li><br>

<li><b>The Dancing Ghost</b><br>In my head, you’re still smiling<br>though you’ve left my heart long ago.<br>Guess you could say that<br>I’m a tired old fool.<br>We were just children,<br>playing the role of adults.<br>Now, that’s all gone<br>on out the window.<br>Keep on dancing in my head,<br>I never lied when I said<br>I’d love you until my death.<br>Now, how many years have gone by<br>since you left in such a fury<br>while I held my broken guts,<br>freezing though those winters<br>and starving for my pride?<br>I’ve loved and failed since then,<br>heard you settled down<br>while I forsook the hallowed ground.<br>You keep on dancing in my head,<br>I didn’t lie when I said<br>I’d love you ‘til the day I die<br>I just can’t be there anymore<br>cause you changed your mind<br>about me.</li><br>

<li><b>Weather Dreams</b><br>Autumn weather<br>precedes her<br>equinox.<br>Spring stayed a week<br>after six and a half<br>months of winter.<br>We’re skipping pleasantries<br>always forgetting<br>to stop for a look<br>at the surrounding beauty.<br>Move slower, speak lower<br>learn to love<br>without expectations<br>perhaps then,<br>we can dream<br>once again.<br></li><br>

<li><b>Wrath</b><br>Come, bring the fires,<br>they dance in mirth and mire<br>for their nailed corpse god,<br>drawing out ancient ire<br>with ignorant indigence<br>indifferent towards the indigenous<br>and the spirits they condemn,<br>draw blood-red lines,<br>sanguine scars upon their<br>dead hearts to carry<br>into the next iteration,<br>weaponless, bloody,<br>denied salvation.<br>Bring the fires,<br>let them burn.<br></li><br>

<li><b>Laundromat</b><br>Outside of the laundromat,<br>we talk about the future<br>and take photos fo the moon.<br>My cigarette tastes terrible,<br>I hate my bad luck<br>and my dirty hands<br>look wrong against this paper.<br>I hope soon<br>that things get better<br>for me, for you<br>for everyone.<br>Until then,<br>let’s enjoy one another,<br>the company we share<br>and the crisp autumn air.<br></li><br>

<li><b>Dead Man Dancing</b><br>The pallid man sat<br>in an old saloon<br>long abandoned,<br>dust ran along every<br>surface of the room.<br>Tales tell of a piano playing<br>late at night,<br>patrons coming and going<br>and every now again<br>a loud fight<br>always ending in a shot.<br>The pallid man gets up,<br>goes to the middle of the room<br>and dances with an unseen entity<br>her beauty<br>all his<br>to see.<br></li><br>

<li><b>Mea Silentis Vox</b><br>I woke up late today<br>and smoked the last cigarette.<br>Money’s a little tight<br>made a check to find out<br>loyalty’s not what I thought it was.<br>Gave it a chance<br>at least honesty’s available.<br>My room’s cold, should turn off the A/C<br>stomach rumbles, should be eating<br>shouldn’t feel so badly<br>can’t help it<br>the voice that usually drives me<br>is deafeningly silent.<br></li><br>

<li><b>20/20</b><br>Twenty, twenty, vision none<br>that's how I've been living my life<br>blindly searching for a partner<br>that'll stay for more than a while<br>now I'm done, grow my hair out<br>won't open my mouth<br>unless I need to<br>need to visit the river soon<br>baptise myself, wash off the sins<br>I've clearly been living in<br>self-deprivation, ignoring the world<br>forgetting the importance of<br>simplicity over complexity<br>come to the ocean with me<br>we'll watch the ghosts all dance<br>upon the rocks below<br>better yet, stay where you are<br>I'd rather love the moon alone.<br></li><br>

<li><b>Puzzles</b><br>Abtruse, multifarious<br>Abstractions<br>splice the parlance of<br>ratiocination<br>foundering a ramshackle actuality<br>heretofore an anomaly of cant and piety<br>this essence has opposed forays<br>seeking to crush the crux<br>upon which this animus<br>endures the angst of being<br>slowly, the psyche seeks<br>reparations<br></li><br>

<li><b>Transom</b><br>The transom window fell open<br>beneath my drunken, bloody palms<br>and the ground rushed in.<br>Without viable reconciliation,<br>I slammed shut the doors<br>that revealed who I was<br>shattering blossoming flowers<br>akin to murano glass.<br>Still, somehow,<br>she found my key<br>and let herself in<br>to plant a new garden<br>and let the light in.<br></li><br>

<li><b>Morgan and Myrddin</b><br>Leaves rustle, the breeze teases<br>all that she touches<br>with her ethereal presence.<br>These mountains glow in<br>Luna’s presence<br>and Morgan Le Fay stands by my side<br>I am Myrddin Wyllt in the guise<br>of a sane soul, though truth be told,<br>these energies are<br>wild, lost and old.<br>The romance within this heart<br>will grow thorny vines of rose<br>for nimue will I fall, begotten by<br>the enchantress’s wile<br>a mad druid overcome<br>by the forces of which he loves.<br>This is all to say<br>I cannot give up<br>for I have so much more to give<br>when it comes to love<br>and time to live.<br></li><br>
