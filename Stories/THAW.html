    <div class="Header"><h1>The Hungry Aching Wood</h1><br><h2>Two NSFW Winnie the Pooh derived parodies</h2></div>
    <div class="Main_Body"><div class="Story_Body">    <h3><b>Kanga and Pooh do too</b></h3>Deep in the hundred acre wood, there lived a bear.<br>The bear had lived in the hundred acre wood for as long as he could remember. He lived in a tree that had a sign on it that he’d believed a long time ago to say welcome. The bear’s name was Edward Bear, although most everyone he knew called him “Pooh”.<br>Tonight, Pooh was getting ready to visit his “very special friend”, Kanga. They’d grown close since his old friend, Christopher Robin, had grown older and stopped visiting. As they grew closer, they’d realized that they enjoyed one another’s company quite a lot. Roo, Kanga’s son, had moved out a few years ago.<br>Sometimes, Tigger joined them. He added excitement to their fun.<br>Tonight, however, it was just the way Pooh liked it: Pooh and Kanga alone and close.<br>Pooh hummed a little song to himself as he dressed himself, checking his stitches for any loose threads. “Oh, hum-diddly, she’ll a fiddly with my willy, I’ll give her honey in her tumm-ily.” Pooh was very satisfied with his little song. “Oh, I should write this one down.” he said to himself, knowing he’d forget why he’d gotten the pencil and paper by the time he found them.<br>Kanga was waiting for Pooh when he got to her house. “You didn’t get lost did you, dear? I know time hasn’t exactly helped you.” She smiles and takes his coat. “I’ve put on the fire and made cookies, just like you like.”<br>“Oh, Kanga, you know you didn’t have to do all of that… though, I don’t suppose a cookie or two would hurt…” Before he’d even sat down, Pooh’d scarfed the entire plate. “I certainly hope you got a few before I did.” He says, feeling a bit bad about the whole thing while he licks his paws.<br>“I certainly got enough, dear.” Kanga rubs Pooh’s shoulders before kissing him passionately. “I’m a bit tired from tending the garden today, a little sore. Would you mind rubbing a few knots out of my back?”<br>“Of course! It’ll be just like squeezing honey out of a beehive.” Kanga lays on a blanket she’s already set on the floor in front of the fire. Pooh straddles her rear and begins rubbing her shoulders and back, all the while humming a little song to himself. “Rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub, massage my love and when I’m done, we’ll make love, out my honey will run.” Kanga giggles quietly, always amused at Pooh’s little songs.<br>Kanga squirms a little bit. “Pooh, could you get my front?” Pooh grins a little bit and gets up.<br>Kanga’s breasts are large and perky, though they pillow out as she lays on her back, letting Pooh between her legs as he rubs her shoulders, sides, them focuses on her breasts, lightly thrusting against her, grinding, before she reaches down and guides him into her aching, needing crevice. Roo’s father hadn’t been nearly as well endowed as Pooh. His 7 inches filled her out nicely and her warm velvety walls caressed Pooh in a way that he’d never felt before. Even Christopher Robin’s hugs hadn’t felt quite as warm. Kanga’s tail thumps and she moans louder “Oh, Pooh! I’m getting so close!” Excited, Pooh thrusts harder and faster, forgetting to worry about his worn stitching until finally…<br>	“Oh bother!” Pooh exclaims, emptying himself in Kanga, who has wrapped herself around him in a near-death grip.<br>	“Oh, Pooh, you’re so wonderful!” Kanga sighs in relief. “Let’s go to bed and sleep.”<br>“Absolutely, Kanga, although I may be in a bit of a spot, if you’d be so kind, could you sew up my rump?”<br>“Of course, you silly little bear.”<br>So, the hundred-acre wood was once again, for a night, quiet, as Owl helped himself while enjoying the show.<br><h3><b>Bouncing the Bear</b></h3>One lazy Sunday morning, there was a knock at Winnie-the-Pooh’s door.<br>“Oh, I wonder who that could be. Maybe the bees with a pot of Honey?” Pooh bear wondered to himself.<br>“Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!” Tigger’s laugh echoes as, very suddenly, Pooh’s door bursts open and before he knows it, Pooh is beneath Tigger. “Hi-ya, Pooh! How are you? Ready to play?”<br>“Oh, Tigger, it’s you. Is our date today?” Pooh, being incredibly forgetful, has forgotten that Tigger and he had planned a bouncy date out into the woods. Tigger had promised to bounce Pooh high enough that Pooh could reach out and get honey from the beehives with little to no effort.<br>“Yep, yep, yep! It’s that day, day, day, old friend of mine!” Tigger jumps up, grabs Pooh and flings him onto his back before bouncing off into the woods.<br>“Oh, bother. Tigger, couldn’t you go just a little slower?” Pooh holds on as tightly as a small stuffed bear might hold onto a springy tigger.<br>“Oh, no, Pooh! I’m too excited! Hoo-hoo! We’re going to have so much fun!” Tigger bounces a little faster until, finally, he finds a tree gently buzzing with bees making their honey.<br>“Tigger, I think my seam has split from all this bouncing. Please be careful.” Pooh rubs his bottom and finds a loose string.<br>	“I hope you’re ready, old friend! You’re about to fly!” With a sudden bounce, Pooh is launched into the air. Quickly, he grabs a branch beside the beehive. “Oh, bother, it would seem I’ve found myself stuck.”<br>Winnie-the-Pooh holds on tightly, his split seam visible to Tigger down below. Pooh reaches out and tries to get some honey. “Ho-hum, my tum-tum wants hon-hon. Ho-tum, I’ll get me some.” Pooh’s grip slips and he falls right on top of Tigger. “Oh, Tigger, I think something may have gotten into my seam. Could you maybe help me?”<br>“Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Why, Pooh, I think I might be in you!” Tigger’s member had slipped directly into Pooh’s bottom. Tigger gets up and bends Pooh bear over, intending to pull himself out.<br>“Actually, Tigger, I don’t quite think I want you out just yet. Maybe we could bounce a bit more like this?”<br>“Why, that’s a wonderful idea, friend! Let’s bounce!”<br>Tigger bounced and bounced, faster and higher each time they came back down. Tigger held Pooh’s arms back so that he didn’t fall away. Pooh’s moans scared the bees away and eventually, they bounced so high up that Pooh reached out and got a fistful of honey.<br>	“Pooh, grab the branch and hold on tight! I’m nearly there and want to go faster!” Pooh holds the branch with one paw and begins stuffing his face as Tigger stuffs his bottom. “Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I’m filling you, Pooh!” Tigger and Pooh tumble down as Tigger explodes inside of his bestest friend. They hit the ground in a sticky mess of honey and Tigger’s seed.<br>“Tigger, I’m a bit tired for the day. Would you mind if we went to bed?”<br>	“Of course, my bestest friend! Some bouncing, huh?”<br>They bounce home, past owl’s, past rabbit’s and piglet’s and past eeyore’s home, all the way back to Pooh’s nice and cozy home.<br>“Nobody ever invites me to their parties.” Eeyore comments, watching as Tigger and Pooh head back to relax after a long bounce.<br><br></div></div><br><br><br><br>
